2. Community Discovery: identification of communities in the network using the following community detection algorithms: Label Propagation, Louvain and K-clique.
3. Diffusion Models: study of opinion diffusion using the following models: Voter, Majority Rule, Sznajd and Q-Voter


**Open Problem**: Analysis of the most relevant user sentiments and topics in the most populated communities identified with the Louvain and K-clique algorithms using Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling techniques
