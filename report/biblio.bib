	abstract = {Community Discovery is among the most studied problems in complex network analysis. During the last decade, many algorithms have been proposed to address such task; however, only a few of them have been integrated into a common framework, making it hard to use and compare different solutions. To support developers, researchers and practitioners, in this paper we introduce a python library - namely {CDlib} - designed to serve this need. The aim of {CDlib} is to allow easy and standardized access to a wide variety of network clustering algorithms, to evaluate and compare the results they provide, and to visualize them. It notably provides the largest available collection of community detection implementations, with a total of 39 algorithms.},

	shorttitle = {{BERTopic}},
	abstract = {Topic models can be useful tools to discover latent topics in collections of documents. Recent studies have shown the feasibility of approach topic modeling as a clustering task. We present {BERTopic}, a topic model that extends this process by extracting coherent topic representation through the development of a class-based variation of {TF}-{IDF}. More specifically, {BERTopic} generates document embedding with pre-trained transformer-based language models, clusters these embeddings, and finally, generates topic representations with the class-based {TF}-{IDF} procedure. {BERTopic} generates coherent topics and remains competitive across a variety of benchmarks involving classical models and those that follow the more recent clustering approach of topic modeling.},

	abstract = {Sentiment or opinion analysis employs natural language processing to extract a significant pattern of knowledge from a large amount of textual data. It examines comments, opinions, emotions, beliefs, views, questions, preferences, attitudes, and requests communicated by the writer in a string of text. It extracts the writer’s feelings in the form of subjectivity (objective and subjective), polarity (negative, positive, and neutral), and emotions (angry, happy, surprised, sad, jealous, and mixed). Thus, this chapter covers the theoretical framework and use cases of sentiment analysis in libraries. The chapter is followed by a case study showing the application of sentiment analysis in libraries using two different tools.},
